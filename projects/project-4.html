            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    A major online learning platform with 500K+ students was experiencing high course dropout rates. 
                    Only 12% of students completed courses they started. Interviews revealed that the interface felt 
                    overwhelming, progress was hard to track, and students didn't know how to navigate their learning journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key pain points identified:
                </p>
                <ul class="case-study-list">
                    <li>Course structure was unclear; students didn't know what to study next</li>
                    <li>No sense of progress or achievement</li>
                    <li>Accessibility issues made learning difficult for users with disabilities</li>
                    <li>Overwhelming course catalog with poor search and filtering</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                
                <h3>Research Phase</h3>
                <p>
                    Led a comprehensive research initiative:
                </p>
                <ul class="case-study-list">
                    <li>25 learner interviews across different demographics and skill levels</li>
                    <li>5,000+ survey responses about learning goals and frustrations</li>
                    <li>Analysis of 100+ courses to identify teaching patterns</li>
                    <li>Accessibility audit revealing WCAG violations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Insights</h3>
                <p>
                    Research revealed that learners want:
                </p>
                <ul class="case-study-list">
                    <li>Clear roadmaps showing where they are and what's next</li>
                    <li>Visible progress that feels motivating, not stressful</li>
                    <li>Simplified interface that doesn't feel like a content dump</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Design & Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    Created wireframes and prototypes testing different approaches to course structure, progress tracking, 
                    and navigation. Conducted moderated usability testing with 12 learners at different stages of their journey. 
                    Tested with assistive technologies (screen readers, magnifiers) to ensure accessibility.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Solution -->
            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h2>Solution</h2>

                <h3>1. Learning Pathways</h3>
                <p>
                    Redesigned course navigation to show clear learning paths with chapters and lessons organized logically. 
                    Students see the full structure upfront and always know where they are. Suggested "next steps" at the 
                    bottom of each lesson.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Progress Visualization</h3>
                <p>
                    Implemented multiple progress indicators without being overwhelming: course-level progress bar, 
                    lesson checkmarks, and achievement badges. Progress feels rewarding, not stressful.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Accessible by Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Built the entire interface with accessibility at the core:
                </p>
                <ul class="case-study-list">
                    <li>Proper semantic HTML with ARIA labels</li>
                    <li>High contrast color combinations (7:1 ratio)</li>
                    <li>Keyboard-only navigation fully supported</li>
                    <li>Captions and transcripts for all video content</li>
                    <li>Tested extensively with screen readers</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Improved Discoverability</h3>
                <p>
                    Redesigned the course catalog with smarter filtering, better search, and personalized recommendations 
                    based on learning history and goals. Course cards now show prerequisites and estimated completion time.
                </p>

                <h3>Impact on Business</h3>
                <p>
                    The redesign had significant business impact: completion rate increased from 12% to 65% (a 5.4x improvement), 
                    course enrollment grew 45%, and student satisfaction scores improved significantly. The platform became 
                    a leader in accessible online education.
                </p>

                <h3>User Feedback</h3>
                <blockquote class="testimonial">
                    "This platform actually feels like it wants to help me learn. The interface got out of the way and I just 
                    focused on the content. I've completed 5 courses now—previously I couldn't finish one."
