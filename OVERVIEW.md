## ✨ Special Features

### 1. One Design Detail (Delight)
**Subtle Hover Lift Animation** - Project cards and buttons have a gentle 4px lift on hover with shadow elevation. Not flashy, but noticeable and premium.

```css
.project-card:hover {
    transform: translateY(-4px);
    box-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### 2. Smooth Active State
Navigation links underline smoothly as you hover:
```css
.nav-link::after {
    transition: width 200ms ease-out;
}
.nav-link:hover::after {
    width: 100%;
}
```

### 3. Smart Spacing
Every pixel of spacing follows the 8px grid - creates visual harmony without being rigid.

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
Site works without JavaScript (links still navigate), JS just makes it smoother.
